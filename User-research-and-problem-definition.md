## 🎯 Target User Group
**University Commuter Students**  
Students who drive from off-campus (often 15–60 minutes away) and must park before attending classes.

## 📝 Problem Description
University (MSU) commuter students face daily challenges finding parking close to their academic buildings. Limited spaces near high-traffic areas (like Business, Science, or Faculty Hall) lead to long walks across campus. When running late, this increases stress, class tardiness, and missed opportunities. The issue is especially problematic during peak morning and midday hours when spots fill quickly.

## 📊 Evidence of the Problem
- *“Today [Monday, April 3, 2023], I went to two different parking lots, and there were no empty spaces, and depending on the time of day and how many classes are going on at that time, usually from nine to noon, that’s the busiest time for parking,”* said senior commuter student **Meg Slatton** ([Murray State News, April 6, 2023](https://murraystatenews.org/195895/news/students-faculty-express-concerns-over-parking-loss/)).
- Ongoing construction projects, such as the new nursing building near Faculty Hall, are expected to further reduce commuter parking availability. Faculty Senate members have already expressed concern over the reallocation of lots and the lack of clarity around future parking plans ([Murray State News, April 6, 2023](https://murraystatenews.org/195895/news/students-faculty-express-concerns-over-parking-loss/)).
- Parking Services acknowledged that while *“abundant parking on the west side of 16th Street”* exists, it is far from the academic core, requiring longer walks that discourage commuter use ([Murray State News, April 6, 2023](https://murraystatenews.org/195895/news/students-faculty-express-concerns-over-parking-loss/)).
- *“By the time I arrive, all the lots near my class are full. I sometimes spend 15 minutes circling before parking far away.”* — **Aayush Agasti**

## ⚖️ Ethical Lens Applied

- **Application:** The parking issue creates inequities, where commuter students waste time, face higher stress, and are more likely to be late compared to those living on campus.
- **Stakeholders Impacted:** Commuter students, faculty dealing with tardiness, campus operations managing lots, and administration focused on student satisfaction and retention.
- **Professional Standard:** Aligns with ACM Code of Ethics 1.1: *“Contribute to society and to human well-being.”*
